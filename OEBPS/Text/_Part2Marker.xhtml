  <h1>Part 2: Test-Driven Development in Object Oriented World</h1>

  <p>Most of the examples I gave you during the previous part were about a single object that did not have dependencies on other objects (with an exception of some values - strings, integers, enums etc.). This is not how a real OO systems are built. In this part, we are finally going to look at scenarios where multiple objects collaborate together as a system.</p>

  <p>This brings about some issues that need to be discussed. One of them is the approach to object oriented design and how it influences the tools we use to test-drive our code. You probably heard something about a tool called mock objects (at least from one of the introductory chapters of this book) or, in more broaded sense, test doubles. If you open your web browser and type "mock objects break encapsulation", you will find a lot of different opinions - some saying that mocks are great, others blaming them for everything bad in the world, and a lot of opinions inbetween those. The discussions are still heated, even though mocks were introduced more than ten years ago. My goal in this chapter is to outline the real context and forces that lead to adoption of mocks and how to use them for your benefit, not failure.</p>

  <p>In order to do this, I need to cover some topics of object oriented design. That is why not all chapters in this part are specifically about TDD, but some are about object oriented techniques, practices and qualities you need to know to use TDD effectively in object oriented world. First of them being dependency injection, and the second being the distinction between objects and values.</p>

  <p>After reading part 2, you will understand how mocks fit into test-driving object oriented code, how to make Statements using mocks maintainable and how some of the practices I introduced in the chapters of part 1 apply to mocks. You will also be able to test-drive simple object oriented systems.</p>
