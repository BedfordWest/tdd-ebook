  <h1>What exactly do we specify?</h1>

  <p>In this chapter, we'll look a little bit on what it is that we actually write our specification against - what exactly do we want to describe about a class. We're gonna jump into a quick example, because I've been keeping you away from practice too long now. Note that the example won't exactly show how the real-world TDD looks like, but it will be enough to draw some conclusions and get a feel of Statement-First style of programming.</p>
