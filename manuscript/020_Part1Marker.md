-# Part 1: Just the basics

In this part I introduce the basic TDD philosophy and practices (as well as some advanced ones) without going much into object orientation and how to do TDD for systems where multiple objects collaborate (which is a topic of Part 2).

So, for the most chapters of this part, I will be giving you examples where a single object (plus some small ones like strings etc.) is exercised to slowly introduce some concepts in an easy to grasp manner.

After reading part 1, you will be able to quite effectively develop classes that have no dependencies on other classes (and on operating system resources).
