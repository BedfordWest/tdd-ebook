## Law of Demeter

As we discovered, exposing return values makes the protocols more complex and should be avoided if possible. TODO do we need this at all?

Law of Demeter. Coupling to details of return values.

Size of protocols. Even interface with a single method can return a lot of values. Example: different reports produced.

## Context independence

## Instead of pulling the data where context is, pass the context where the data is

TODO move this earlier in the chapter

If you are like me, you probably learned programming starting from
procedural languages.

this may sound like something non obvious

1.  data - the information
2.  context - what we want to do with information

e.g. for employees:

1.  data - employee name surname etc.
2.  context - we want to print it on the screen

TODO example: with employees loop getters refactoring

May be more coupling, but the coupling is very light - just an abstract interface, especially if we were following the rest guidelines. On the other hand, better information hiding and decoupling users from details.

#### Protocols should rely on abstractions

e.g. Id abstraction can be either in or string or a combination of those. The protocol stays stable regardless of these changes

Plural is also an abstraction
--------------------------------

TODO

## Avoid statics


#### Interactions are not an implementation detail

Todo interfaces checked by compiler, protocols not

### multiple interfaces multiple roles

Protocols must be published! They are not private internal details


TOOODOOO

Why did I leave out inline creation and singletons? context independence!
-------------------------------------------------------------------------

1.  composability - learned from previous chapters
2.  what does it mean to compose - obtain reference. Plug objects
    together - show UML version of composition first, then the version
    with "plugs".
3.  composability long term (through constructor or setter) or short
    term (through parameter)?
4.  composability - strong or weak a) class vs interface, b)(continuum
    -public field, getter, method that does something)
5.  In order to compose - Protocols vs interfaces
6.  Abstract protocols are better
7.  web of composable objects - like a real web - metaphor (when?)
8.  Tell Don't Ask (when?)
9.  Why not events? Roles!!!
10. discover interfaces - from inside or outside?
11. need driven development


1. In interfaces chapter - provide better examples in roles section (use some more real examples)
3. change many single hyphens to double

## No work in constructors

A constructor of a class should do little or no work. This is a conclusion from Single Responsibility Principle which also enhances composability.

If, aside from implementing the methods a class exposes, you feel you need to do additional work in a constructor, that may be a sign that this "additional work" changes for other reason than the main logic of the class. Thus it should be put elsewhere.



### What can a constructor do?

Most of the times, we can get away using the following guideline: assigning fields or null checks. 

### What a constructor cannot do?

if it does too much, it means it's a separate responsibility. Move it to the factory.



TODO give open connection instead of opening it in constructor
TODO validation - put in factories, except nulls - an object requires valid peers.

TODO small amount of private methods

# DSL chapter

%% ### Hide irrelevant parts of composition - few levels of composition code is enough
%% 1.  Factory method & method composition
%% 1.  Method chaining - expression builders build up context
%% 1.  variable as terminator ??? Explaining variables - for sharing
%% 1.  Explaining method (i.e. returns its argument. Use with care)


# Value objects

## Value objects as dividing a domain space

When talking about objects that were playing roles, sending messages and implementing interfaces, we talked a lot about making the protocols as abstract as possible and  

Todo: interfaces let us treat related objects the same, and values let us separate unrelated objects.
