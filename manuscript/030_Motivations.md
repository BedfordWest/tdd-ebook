Motivation -- the first step to learning TDD
===========================================

I am a TDD enthusiast. I believe TDD is a huge improvement over other software development disciplines I have used. If this is true not only for me, but for most of the software developers, then everyone should learn TDD and use it, shouldn't they? Yet, I haven't seen the adoption rate to be big enough to justify the claim that TDD is mainstream.

You are already in a great position, because you decided to pick up a book. I am honored and happy you chose this one, no matter if this is your first book on TDD or maybe you've read, like, nine of them. As much as I really hope you will read all of it, I am aware it doesn't always happen. That makes me want to ask you an important question that may help you determine whether you really want to read it: why do you want to learn TDD?

By questioning your motivation, I'm not trying to discourage you from reading this book. Rather, I'd like you to reconsider the goal you want to achieve by reading it. A few years ago, I had an apprentice who wanted to learn TDD. Together we started working on a small project to let him grasp the necessary skills through practice, with me sitting next to him, providing guidance. He showed up three, four times, then he resigned, having "more urgent things to do" and "no time". Since then, he did not progress in TDD at all. Even today, I sometimes wonder what was his motivation and why it somehow burned out. 

Over time, I noticed that some of us (me included) may *think we need* to learn something (as opposed to *wanting to learn something) for whatever reasons -- getting promotion at work, gaining a certificate, add something to CV or just "stay up to date" with recent hypes, one of them being Test-Driven Development.

Some of us may have a vague knowledge of what are the real costs and benefits of TDD. Knowing that TDD is valued and praised by others, we may draw conclusions that it has to be good for us as well. We may have a vague understanding of the reasons, like “the code will be more tested". As we don't know the real "why" of TDD, we may make up some reasons to practice test-first development, like "to ensure tests are written for everything". Don't get me wrong, these statements might be partially true, however, they miss a lot of the essence of the “why" of TDD. When we fail to understand more, dissapointment may creep in. I heard such disappointed practitioners saying "I don’t really need TDD, because I need tests that give me confidence on a broader scope" or: "Why do I need unit tests when I already have integration tests, smoke tests, sanity tests, exploration tests...?". Many times, I saw TDD getting abandoned before ever being achieved.

Is learning TDD a high priority for you? Are you determined to try it out and really learn it? If you're not, hey, I heard the new series of Game Of Thrones is on TV, why don’t you check it out instead? Ok, I’m just teasing, however, as some say, TDD is “easy to learn, hard to master"[^easytolearn], so without some guts to move on, it will be hard. Especially that my plan is to introduce the content slowly and gradually, so that you can get better understanding of TDD.

How TDD feels like
------------------

My brother and I liked to play video games in our childhood -- one of the most memorable being Tekken 3 -- a Japanese tournament beat’em up for Sony Playstation. Beating the game with all the warriors and unlocking all hidden bonuses, mini-games etc. took about a day. Some could say the game had nothing to offer since then. Why is it then that we spent more than a year on it?

It is because each fighter in the game had a lot of combos, kicks and punches that could be mixed in a variety of ways. Some were only usable in certain situations, others were something I could throw at our opponents almost anytime without a big risk of being exposed to counterattacks. I could side-step to evade enemy’s attacks and, most of all, I could kick another fighter up in the air where they could not block my attacks and I was able to land some nice attacks on them before they fell down. These in-the-air techniques were called “juggles". There were magazines that published lists of new juggles each month and the hype has stayed in the gaming community for well over a year.

Yes, Tekken was easy to learn -- I could put one hour into training the core moves of a character and then be able to “use" this character, but I knew what would made me a great fighter was the experience and knowledge on which techniques were risky and which were not, which ones could be used in which situations, which ones, if used one after another, gave the opponent little chance to counterattack etc. No wonder that soon many tournaments sprang, where players could clash for glory, fame and rewards. Even today, you can watch some of those old matches on youtube.

TDD is like Tekken. You have probably heard the mantra “red-green-refactor" or the general advice “write your test first, then the code", maybe you even did some experiments on your own where you were trying to implement a bubble-sort algorithm or other simple stuff by starting with a test. But that is all like practicing Tekken by trying out each move on its own on a dummy opponent, without the context of real-world issues that make the fight really challenging. And while I think such exercises are very useful (in fact, I do a lot of them), I find an immense benefit in understand the bigger picture as well.

Some people I talk to about TDD sum up what I say to them as: “That is really demotivating -- there are so many things I have to watch out for that it makes me never want to start!". Easy, don’t panic -- remember the first time you tried to ride a bike -- you might have been really far back then from knowing traffic regulations and following road signs, but that didn't really keep you away, did it? 

I find TDD very exciting and, thanks to it, I am excited about writing code as well. Some guys of my age already think they know all about coding, are bored with it and cannot wait until they move to management or requirements or business analysis, but hey! I have a new technique that makes my coding career challenging again! And it is a skill that I can apply to many different technologies and languages, making me a better developer overall! Isn't that something worth aiming for?

## Let's get it started!

In this chapter, I tried to provoke you make you rethink your attitude and motivation. If you are still determined to learn TDD with me by reading this book, which I hope you are, then let's get to work! 

[^easytolearn]: I don’t know who said it first, I searched the web and found it in few places where none of the writers gave credit to anyone else for it, so I decided just to mention that I’m not the one that coined this phrase.
