Hi!

It's been some time since I last published. This version contains an overhaul of chapter "Practicing what we have already learned" - the one where Johnny and Benjamin try to take on a simple problem using TDD. By the way, I noticed that the title of this chapter is misleading, since it not only repeats some of the already covered elements, but also introduces several new ones. I'm still searching for a better name - if you have some ideas, please let me know!

Anyway, as for this chapter, I corrected a lot of typos and misleading sentences, I also found some small errors in the code. I also managed to include several fixes by contributors (see pull requests on github page). Overall, I feel the chapter is in much better shape now than it was earlier.

I received some comments about these chapters that include Johnny and Benjamin. Some said they're not needed and that they repeat the somewhat naive narrative of Uncle Bob's Craftsman articles (e.g. http://thecleancoder.blogspot.com/2010/10/craftsman-62-dark-path.html, btw, I myself liked this series and I think Robert is better writer than me when it comes to building a story) or his even more naive and tendentious dialog-blog posts (e.g. https://blog.8thlight.com/uncle-bob/2014/05/14/TheLittleMocker.html, btw, I like them as well, although I agree with the tendentiousness charge). On the other hand, I received some thumbs up, saying that these chapters reveal a lot about the questions one rises when they encounter certain patterns and techniques and that they do a fine job showing the dynamics of TDD and object oriented design process. Based on this, these chapters will stay in the book and I may add some more when necessity arises. Still, if you have an opinion, please let me know!

Best regards and happy reading!
